Following our [Series A announcement](https://mdxjs.com) in April, I'm happy to announce a new 
**Vercel $40M Series B** round led by [GV](https://mdxjs.com), with [Greenoaks](https://mdxjs.com),
[Bedrock](https://mdxjs.com), [Geodesic](https://mdxjs.com), existing investors [Accel](https://mdxjs.com) & 
[CRV](https://mdxjs.com).

Reflecting on the growth of our business, which in 2020 alone added the likes of Airbnb, The Washington Post, Trip Advisor, Scale and Hashicorp as flagship customers, I'm sharing 7 tailwinds behind our acceleration.

Why are teams of all sizes choosing to develop, preview and ship their websites with [Next.js]( https://nextjs.org/)and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/? ) Where are we going next?

## [#]( https://nextjs.org/) Vercel is frontend focused

Jeff Bezos' famous Day 1 letter to shareholders goes:

- [x] Trial 1
- [x] Mark down support
- [x] Next.js
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

- There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused.
- you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, 
- obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.


``` 
Every interaction with your customer goes through your frontend,
from their first contact with your brand, every purchase, 
every signup, every article, every form submission.
```

And each time, your frontend has an opportunity to impress, delight, perform, be accessible and memorable.

What's more, frontend is an area of technological and artistic differentiation,

***while backend becomes increasingly commoditized, turnkey and undifferentiated.***
